# Setting Up an NGINX Web Server: My Journey Through DevOps Stage 0

## Task Overview
The goal was to:

- Install and configure NGINX on an Ubuntu server.
- Serve a custom HTML page at `/var/www/html/index.html` with the message:
  
  **"Welcome to DevOps Stage 0 - Makanju Favour/Fave"**
  
- Ensure the webpage is accessible via the public IP of the server.
- Document the experience in a blog post.
- Overall, demonstrate my ability to work with basic web server configurations and deliver a functional web server.


## Approach to Completing the Task

### Step 1: Provisioning a Cloud Server
I chose to use an AWS EC2 instance (`t2.micro`, Ubuntu 24.04) for this task. I launched the instance with the following setup:

- **OS:** Ubuntu 24.04 LTS  
- **Security Group:** Allowed HTTP (port 80) and SSH (port 22)  
- **Key Pair:** Used for SSH access  

### Step 2: Installing and Enabling NGINX
After SSH-ing into the server, I updated the package lists and installed NGINX:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y nginx
```

After installation, I started and enabled NGINX to ensure it runs on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```

I then confirmed that NGINX was running with:

```bash
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

The output confirmed that NGINX was **active (running)**.

### Step 3: Creating the Custom HTML Page
When I navigated to `/var/www/html/`, I noticed that the existing file was named `index.nginx-debian.html` instead of `index.html`.

#### Solution:
I renamed the file using:

```bash
sudo mv /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html /var/www/html/index.html
```

Then, I opened it with `vim` to edit the content:

```bash
sudo vim /var/www/html/index.html
```

I added the required content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>DevOps Stage 0</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to DevOps Stage 0 - Makanju Favour/Fave</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

Then, I saved and exited the file (`ESC`, then `:wq`).

### Step 4: Adjusting File Permissions
I ensured that NGINX could read the file:

```bash
sudo chmod 644 /var/www/html/index.html
```

### Step 5: Restarting NGINX
After making changes, I restarted NGINX to apply the updates:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

To verify that the configuration was working, I tested it with:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

The output confirmed that the configuration file was correct.

### Step 6: Accessing the Web Page
Then, I entered `http://<my-server-ip>/` in my browser.
my-server-ip = 3.95.230.183

ðŸŽ‰ **It worked!** I saw the message:  
**"Welcome to DevOps Stage 0 - Makanju Favour/Fave"**

## Challenges Faced and How I Solved Them

### 1. `index.html` Not Found Error
When I navigated to `/var/www/html/`, the file `index.html` wasn't missing but had a different name (`index.nginx-debian.html`).

#### Solution:
I renamed it using:

```bash
sudo mv /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html /var/www/html/index.html
```

Then, I edited the file using:

```bash
sudo vim /var/www/html/index.html
```
